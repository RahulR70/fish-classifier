Fish Image Classifier
 Project Overview
This project is a Fish Image Classification system built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Streamlit.
It allows users to upload fish images and predicts the fish category along with model confidence scores.

The project uses TensorFlow/Keras for training and inference, and integrates a Streamlit web app for interactive use.

 Dataset
Source: Fish dataset (images of multiple fish species).

Preprocessing:

Images resized and rescaled to [0, 1] range.

Data augmentation techniques like rotation, zoom, and flipping applied to improve robustness.

⚙️ Installation
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fish-classifier.git
cd fish-classifier
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Ensure you have the dataset in the correct directory.

 Usage
1️⃣ Train the Model
Run the training script to build the CNN model:

bash
Copy
Edit
python train_model.py
2️⃣ Run the Streamlit App
Start the interactive web app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
Upload a fish image, and the app will display the predicted fish category along with confidence scores.

 Model Details
CNN architecture with convolutional, pooling, and dense layers.

Optimizer: Adam

Loss: Categorical Crossentropy

Metrics: Accuracy

Trained using data augmentation for better generalization.
